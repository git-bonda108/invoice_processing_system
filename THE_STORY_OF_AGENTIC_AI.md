## 🎬 **The Opening Scene: A World Before Agentic AI**

Imagine a typical Monday morning at **TechCorp Solutions**, a mid-size technology company. Sarah, the accounts payable manager, walks into her office to find:
- 📄 **47 invoices** from vendors like Microsoft, AWS, and local contractors waiting to be processed
- 📋 **12 contracts** including software licenses, cloud services, and consulting agreements needing review  
- 🚨 **3 critical anomalies** that could cost the company $50,000+ in duplicate payments and compliance violations
- ⏰ **Only 8 hours** to process everything before month-end close

Sarah's heart sinks. She knows that manually cross-referencing each invoice against contracts, MSAs, and lease agreements is impossible for one person to handle accurately. Missing a PO number mismatch or vendor rate discrepancy could mean financial losses and audit failures.

But what if Sarah had **9 specialized AI agents** working autonomously around the clock, each an expert in their domain, communicating seamlessly, and catching every single anomaly?

**Welcome to the future of invoice processing and anomaly detection.**
